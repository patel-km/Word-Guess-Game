            //List of letters guessed (array to add keystrokes to)
            //Chances left to guess (total number -1 every time letter guessed is not in the word)

        //Light up signal and maybe sound after initial keystroke to visually signal that game has begun

        //2nd keystroke triggers the following events:
        //add letter guess in letter bank
        //fill in blanks on word if applicable
        //effect or no effect in the "chances left"

        //No effect for a repeated keystroke

        //Chances run out = Lose game

        //Word filled in before chances run out = Win game

        //Reset the elements for a new game and add new word
